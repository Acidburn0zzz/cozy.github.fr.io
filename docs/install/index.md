# Install Cozy on your own server

This documentation is in its early stage of writing.

For now, we’ll only explain how to [install Cozy by hand](install/manual.md). This is neither the easiest path to follow, nor the recommended one. It requires to have some knowledge of the command line.

In the near future, we’ll provide packages and images to make hosting Cozy easier.
