You have to install it and all this dependencies by hand. This tutorial is intended for tech savvy people wanting to give Cozy a first try without waiting for the official documentation and images.\n\n\nPre-requisites\nCozy requires a CouchDB 2 database server and a reverse proxy. We\u2019ll use Nginx in this tutorial but feel free to use your reverse proxy of choice.\nInstall dependencies\nOn a fresh new Debian Jessie, are are the packages that may be useful to install and manage your server:\napt-get update \n apt-get --no-install-recommends -y install \n\\\n\n            ca-certificates \n\\\n\n            curl \n\\\n\n            net-tools \n\\\n\n            nginx \n\\\n\n            sudo \n\\\n\n            vim-tiny \n\\\n\n            build-essential \n\\\n\n            pkg-config \n\\\n\n            erlang \n\\\n\n            libicu-dev \n\\\n\n            libmozjs185-dev \n\\\n\n            libcurl4-openssl-dev\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall CouchDB\nDownload \nthe source code on CouchDB 2\n and \n\ninstall it\n.\ncd\n /tmp\ncurl -LO https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/couchdb/source/2.0.0/apache-couchdb-2.0.0.tar.gz\ntar xf apache-couchdb-2.0.0.tar.gz\n\ncd \napache-couchdb-2.0.0\n./configure\nmake release\nadduser --system \n\\\n\n        --no-create-home \n\\\n\n        --shell /bin/bash \n\\\n\n        --group --gecos \n\\\n\n        \nCouchDB Administrator\n couchdb\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll install CouchDB inside \n/home/couchdb\n:\ncp -R rel/couchdb /home/couchdb\nchown -R couchdb:couchdb /home/couchdb\nfind /home/couchdb -type d -exec chmod \n0770\n \n{}\n \n\\;\n\nchmod -R \n0644\n /home/couchdb/etc\nmkdir /var/log/couchdb \n chown couchdb: /var/log/couchdb\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, we\u2019ll just run the database as a background job, but it is highly recommended to use some supervisor software.\nsudo -b -i -u couchdb sh -c \n/home/couchdb/bin/couchdb \n /var/log/couchdb/couch.log 2\n /var/log/couchdb/couch-err.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, let\u2019s create de default databases:\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_users\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The default CouchDB installation has no admin user. Everybody can query the server. So, in production environment, make sure tu create en admin user and update the CouchDB connexion URL inside the configuration file of Cozy.\n\n\nInstall the Cozy Stack\nThe Cozy server is just a single binary. You can fetch one of its releases from Github:\ncurl -o /usr/local/bin/cozy-stack -L https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/releases/download/2017M1-alpha/cozy-stack-linux-amd64-2017M1-alpha\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/cozy-stack\nadduser --system \n\\\n\n        --no-create-home \n\\\n\n        --shell /bin/bash \n\\\n\n        --group --gecos \n\\\n\n          \nCozy\n cozy\nmkdir /var/log/cozy\nchown cozy: /var/log/cozy\nmkdir /var/lib/cozy\nchown -R cozy: /var/lib/cozy\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure your server using a JSON or YAML file.
